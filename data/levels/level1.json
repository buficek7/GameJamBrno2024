It has come to my attention that you are currently considering which candidate to vote for in the impending leadership election. I implore you to consider Ms. Barrend as she presents a unique set of solutions that no other candidate can match. Her plan to increase the birth rate of the cult through orgies will not only bring in more members but will also ensure the longevity and growth of the organization and her proposal to re-brand as a charitable organization has the potential to garner outside support. In conclusion, it is clear that Ms. Barrend presents an innovative vision. I understand that the other candidate is advocating a policy of aggressive isolation that's in line with doctrine. However, I would like to point out that such a strategy is likely to be counterproductive. Alex simply lacks the experience to properly lead us. The cult's future prosperity depends on keeping a balance between isolation and interaction with the world.\n\nI sincerely urge you to consider her proposal and cast your vote accordingly."]
